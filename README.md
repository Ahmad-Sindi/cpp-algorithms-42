Algorithm Challenge #42 – Task Duration in Seconds
=
🧮 Problem Description
=
This challenge focuses on calculating the total duration of a task in seconds.
The user provides the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds, and the program calculates the total time in seconds.

💡 What You’ll Learn
=
Reading multiple numeric inputs in C++

Converting units (days → seconds, hours → seconds, minutes → seconds)

Performing arithmetic operations

Writing clean and readable output

Strengthening programming logic for real-world tasks

🧩 Example
=
Input:

Enter the number of days you worked: 1
Enter the number of hours you worked: 2
Enter the number of minutes you worked: 30
Enter the number of seconds you worked: 45


Output:

Total task duration: 95445 Seconds

📂 File Information
=
Language: C++

File Name: task_duration_seconds.cpp

Challenge Number: #42

💬 Notes
=
This challenge reinforces unit conversion logic and shows how small increments (days, hours, minutes, seconds) can be combined programmatically into a single measure (seconds).
